no-Click Virtual Keyboard

Welcome!

Different countries have different keyboard layouts, such as the UK and USA, so we need an array of label key codes and the actual visual key.

To create your own keyboard follow these steps:

1. Download Java and the no-Click software.

2. Use node key sender key codes to create your keyboard, here is the page: https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-key-sender

3. Some keys may not be accessible through a key word so you will have to use ```keySender.sendCombination(['shift', specialIcons[i]]);```
