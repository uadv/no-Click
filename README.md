no-Click Virtual Keyboard

Welcome!

Different countries have different keyboard layouts, such as the UK and USA, so we need an array of label key codes and the actual visual key.

To create your own keyboard follow these steps:

1. Download Java and the no-Click software.

2. Use node key sender key codes to create your keyboard, here is the page: https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-key-sender

3. Some keys may not be accessible through a key word so you will have to use ```keySender.sendCombination(['shift', specialIcons[i]]);``` This will shift click the button that your desired text is on.

4. If you have a mix of normal and shift click keys you are going to want to place the normal keys at the front and the shift keys at the back!

5. Submit your key array in the keyArray javascript file and I will test it if possible and add it in the keyboard type list!
